ðŸš€ EfficientNet-Finetuning-SUN20

Fine-tuning EfficientNetV2 on the SUN20 dataset for high-accuracy scene classification.

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project focuses on image classification using deep learning techniques. The following key aspects were implemented:

Custom CNN Model: Implemented a convolutional neural network (CNN) for scene classification.

Fine-tuning EfficientNetV2: Leveraged a pre-trained EfficientNetV2-M model and fine-tuned it for improved performance.

Data Augmentation & Regularization: Used techniques like batch normalization, dropout, and image augmentations.

Optimization Techniques: Experimented with Adam optimizer, learning rate scheduling, and weight decay to improve accuracy.

Achieved 91.8% Validation Accuracy on the SUN20 dataset.
